# customer_segmentation

Problem Statement:

    Customer segmentation lies at the heart of every consumer facing business nowadays which involves being able to identify different types of customers and then figuring out ways to find more of those individuals so we can get more customers!

    In this assessment, I have done exactly that, albeit with the help of K-Means clustering and observe how i can form groups of customers exhibiting similar behaviour.

About the dataset:

    I have a dataset consisting of two sheets, with names OfferInformation and Transactions. OfferInformation has 32 rows and 7 columns while Transactions has 324 rows and 3 columns. Below I have explained all features:

For OfferInformation Sheet:

    Offer #	: Order ID
    Campaign :	Month of the campaign
    Varietal :	Grape variety
    Minimum Qty(kg) :	Minimum quantity ordered in kgs
    Discount(%) :	Discount on that order
    Origin : Country where the variety of grape is grown
    Past Peak	: If wine flavor has faded
    
For transaction sheet:

    Customer Last Name :	Name of the customer purchasing
    Offer #	: Offer ID
